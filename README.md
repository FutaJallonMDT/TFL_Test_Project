I created this project using Specflow Nunit, Selenenium Webdriver with C# as it an ideal framework template which is required to complete this task, and also its is mostly used in Most Organisation and couple of its easy use for stability in test automation. Dependencies used within this framework Includes : A Specflow Nunit, Selenium Webdriver, Nunit/Test Adapter, WebDriverManager, Selenium Support Amongst Others. I adopted a page Object Model/Architeture due to its ease of use which helps to reduce code redundancy and complexity and helps to increase test script maintainance by creating a Class File for each web page. This class file which holds and contains web elements that are avilable on the Web Page and its Operational Method. 
Directories used in this project includes 1. Drivers > DriverHelpers (This class holds the Object repository for Webdriver and Ibrowser) 2. Features > PlanAJourneyTFL.Feature (This File holds the Scenarios Under Test) 3. Hooks > BaseHooks (This Class is responsible for initialising the test and finishing the test off which is Setup and Tear Down, before scenario and After Scenario) 4. Pages (This is responsibles for Housing all the elements used withing the test Mappped to each Pages. 5. Step Definition > TFL_Test_Project.StepDefinitions (This class contains its corresponding step binding for the scenario steps in the feature file. Support > Enviroment (This us a resource file which allows me to store my Url) Helpers > JsExtension and WaitExtension (This class helps to Inherit all the methods from another class which is very useful for code reusabilty)
